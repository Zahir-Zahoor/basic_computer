CPU: Brain of the computer, processes instructions.
RAM: Temporary memory for running programs.
ROM: Permanent memory storing essential programs.
Motherboard: Main circuit board connecting all components.
Monitor/Printer/Mouse/Keyboard: Input/output devices.
OS: Software that manages hardware and software resources.
Internet & Networking: Connects computers (LAN/WAN), uses URLs to access sites.
Cybersecurity: Protects computers from viruses and attacks.

Python Basics: def to define functions, loops for repetition, if-else for decisions, try-except for errors.
Data Types: int, float, str, bool; lists and tuples store data; dict stores key-value pairs.
Operators: Perform math or comparisons.
Web Basics: HTML structures pages, CSS styles them, JS adds interactivity.
Networking: Devices like routers/switches connect and direct data; WLAN for wireless access.

OOP: class defines objects, self represents the object, __init__ initializes, inheritance shares features.
SQL: SELECT reads data, INSERT adds data, DROP removes tables, COMMIT saves changes.
API: Allows software to interact with other software.
OS Concepts: Scheduler manages CPU, virtual memory simulates large memory, deadlocks are circular waits.
Web: HTTP/HTTPS are protocols for communication.

# Stage 4
stage4 = """
Python Advanced: yield creates generators, decorators modify functions, super() accesses parent methods.
SQL Advanced: JOIN combines tables, transactions ensure safe changes, normalization organizes data.
OS Advanced: Paging loads needed memory, virtualization simulates hardware, multitasking allows multiple processes.
Networking & Web: DNS translates names to IPs, REST API methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) handle resources, HTTPS secures communication.
